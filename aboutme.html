      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">On the first week of GWC we worked on making sratch projects from this scratch
      <br> This is my account---><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MEIJ03">Meij03</a> </p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Here are some scratch games that we made in class with a partner at GWC. <br>The left is called Pong Game and the right is my incomplete side scroller game</p>

          <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">The point of our side-scroller game was so that it would be like a running fruit ninja and it is suppose to jump over the fruits that comes it's way, however that was not completed as the apple did not stop when it did touch the ninija. Please excuse the ugly ninja, it was drawn with the mouse on the laptop</p>
